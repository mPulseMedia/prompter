9. conclusion
	a. system_philosophy
		1. The codename system represents a fundamental shift from traditional code organization to a living, navigable architecture.
		2. Its current strength lies in consistency and systematic thinking.
		3. Its future potential lies in making that system so intuitive and delightful that developers prefer exploring code through codenames rather than traditional file browsing.
	b. key_insight
		1. Code is not just text—it's a living system of relationships.
		2. Codenames make those relationships visible, searchable, and navigable.
		3. The browser interface transforms abstract naming conventions into concrete, interactive exploration tools.
	c. future_potential
		1. With the suggested enhancements, particularly the execution flow visualization and intuitive navigation aids, the system could evolve from a functional tool into an indispensable development environment.
		2. This fundamentally changes how developers understand and work with code.
