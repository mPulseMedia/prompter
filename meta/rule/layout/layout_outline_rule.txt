NOTE: This file defines rules for managing and formatting rules in the project.

1. format
    a. numbering
        1. Use outline numbering (1.a.1.a).
        2. Each level must be indented with one tab.
        3. Each line must have a number or letter.
        4. Each instruction must end with a period.
    b. width
        1. Keep all lines under 80 characters wide.
        2. Make the wrap look good.

2. manage
    a. rule_add
        1. Check existing rules before creating new ones.
        2. Add to existing rule file if topic matches.
        3. Create new rules only if necessary.
        4. Use simple one-line rules when sub-items are not needed.
        5. Pick the correct file to add new rules in.
    b. content
        1. Make rules that are conventions, yet specific and actionable.
        2. Start with a verb.
        3. End with a period.
        4. One rule per line.
        5. Never have vague or marketing language.
        6. The more top level, the shorter the line should be.
        7. Watch for uniform step counts across sections as a sign of fluff.
        8. Prefer fewer meaningful steps over padded lists.

3. format_file
    a. structure
        1. Group related rules together.
        2. Index files start directly with first entry.
        3. Index files have no header or footer formatting.
    b. examples
        1. Put examples in a separate section.
        2. Clearly mark examples as examples.
        3. Follow all other rules.
        4. Show before/after if relevant.
