NOTE: This file defines the rules for formatting index files that list codenames.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1. File Structure:
   - Start with a header section enclosed by comment lines (////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////)
   - Include a NOTE line explaining the file's purpose
   - End header with comment lines
   - List codenames with line numbers
   - End with a blank line

2. Line Numbering:
   - Use two-digit numbers (01-99) followed by a period and space
   - Numbers must be right-aligned (e.g., "01.", "02.", etc.)
   - No leading zeros for numbers 10 and above

3. Codenames:
   - List all codenames alphabetically
   - Each codename must be on its own line
   - First line in a group shows the full codename
   - Subsequent lines show only the unique suffix
   - When a codename shares a prefix with the line above:
     * Replace the entire matching prefix with spaces
     * Use exactly one space per character in the matching prefix
     * Keep only the unique suffix
   - When a codename shares a prefix with multiple lines above:
     * Use the longest matching prefix from the most recent line
     * Replace all matching characters with spaces
     * Keep only the unique suffix

4. Prefix Alignment:
   - For each line, compare it with the line above
   - If the current line starts with the same prefix as the line above:
     * Replace the entire prefix with spaces
     * Use exactly one space per character in the prefix
     * Show only the suffix
   - If the current line has no prefix match with the line above:
     * Show the full codename
     * Start a new group
   - The indentation of each group is determined by the first line in that group

5. Example Format:
   ```
   01. circle
   02.       _border_color
   03.               thickness
   04.        is
   05.        radius
   ```

6. Special Cases:
   - If a codename is a subset of another (e.g., "circle" and "circle_border"):
     * The shorter codename must come first
     * The longer codename must show only its unique suffix
   - If multiple codenames share the same prefix but have different suffixes:
     * List them in alphabetical order of their suffixes
     * Each line must show only the unique suffix part
   - If a codename has no prefix match with the line above:
     * Write the full codename
     * Start a new group
   - For single-word suffixes (like "is" and "radius"):
     * Show only the suffix
     * Maintain the same prefix spacing as the group

7. Spacing Rules:
   - Use exactly one space per character in the matching prefix
   - Each group maintains its own indentation level
   - The first line in a group determines the indentation for that group
   - Do not add extra spaces for alignment
   - Do not use tabs or multiple spaces for indentation
   - Preserve the exact number of spaces that would be occupied by the matching prefix

8. Validation:
   - Each line must be numbered
   - All codenames must be alphabetically sorted
   - No duplicate codenames allowed
   - Each line must show either:
     * The full codename (if first in a group)
     * Only the unique suffix (if in an existing group)
   - The number of spaces must exactly match the number of characters in the matching prefix
   - Each group must maintain consistent indentation
