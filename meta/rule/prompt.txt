NOTE: This file defines the complete process for managing and executing prompts in app development.

1. execute
    a. files
        1. creation
            a. After creating any file, run these steps in order:
                1. Read code.txt and apply all alignment rules
                2. Read codename.txt and verify all names
                3. Read format.txt and apply all structure rules
                4. If any rule fails, fix before proceeding
        2. validation
            a. For each file, check these in order:
                1. code.txt: alignment of =, :, ;, =>
                2. code.txt: indentation and spacing
                3. codename.txt: snake_case names
                4. codename.txt: name length under 15 chars
                5. format.txt: file structure
                6. format.txt: section dividers
    b. tools
        1. run_terminal_cmd
